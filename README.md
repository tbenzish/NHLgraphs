# NHLgraphs
A little project to try to figure out the NHL api

Built with Python and Django utilizing the public NHL api

Current Limitations:
- Only handles exact input of names of Buffalo Sabres
- Does not allow for removing players from the database
- Shows few statistics
- Doesn't provide much in way of comparison of players

Goals:
- Make every NHL player ever searchable (potential performance issues?)
- Implement an autofill search bar
- Allow removal of players from the database (Wipe all players on refresh)
- Utilize chart.js to make the visual experience more robust
- Host on AWS
